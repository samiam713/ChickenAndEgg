# Egg:
Egg is a self printing program - this waw the hard part.
This is the pseudocode solution in a language that has built in strings and uses variables for assignment (pretty much every language I know).

COMMAND 1:
    Store bytes representing COMMAND 2 and COMMAND 3 in variable "x" using a literal.
    
COMMAND 2:
    Print COMMAND 1 by printing the declaration syntax then printing variable "x" as a literal.
    
COMMAND 3:
    Print COMMAND 2 and COMMAND 3 by printing "x" converted to a String.

# Chicken:
Chicken is the program I used to make Egg.
I guess it's an analogy for how the first chicken laid the genetically mutated egg.

Maybe God started the universe with both chickens and eggs and simply placed fossils etc. on the planet in a way such that when we extrapolate backwards it seems like evolution occured. Maybe he started the universe this morning?
